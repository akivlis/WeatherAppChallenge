Weather App as Coding Assignments for Job Interview

The task was to create a basic app, which would show the weather for the upcoming week in the current location using OpenWeatherAPI. Ideally, the app should show the last loaded data in the offline state. 
I was told not to invest more than 2-3 hours, so I decided to go with SwiftUI and this is what I came out with.
